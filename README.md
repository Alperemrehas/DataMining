# DataMining

In this reprosority I will provide some codes in which exist implementation of the some fundamental Data Mining concepts. The codes and sampledefinitions and process will be provided but the sample datas are not going to be provided. For the datasets that are related withe the code will be shared if you need it personally.

1- Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm and SON Algorithm)

2- Classification
